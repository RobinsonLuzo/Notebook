# Notebook: an Instagram-like application.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobinsonLuzo/Notebook/master/img/Profile_screenshot.JPG" alt="Profile Screenshot" width="300"/>

Work in progress personal project. Currently enabled to:

- Allow for new user creation.

- Login and Logout for users from Navabr (under "Settings")

- Home page of photos from other users a given user is following.

- Follow/Unfollow other users. 

- Like and saving/favoriting other users photos.

- Post new photos.

- See all photos associate with a given hashtag.

**Additonal Functionality to come:**

- Enabling more profile-based information such as editing details of user + profile photo and comments on posts.

- Direct Messaging and Notifications.

- Video and Stories *a-la* Instagram will likely follow after these, but will require mre library imports.

**Note:** Actions involving posting photos etc require a user to be logged in to work correctly. Log in first or create a new profile if starting the app for the first time. This can be done at: "user/login" and selecting the option to Create a new profile.

## Bugs/TODO:

29.07.21 - User profile creation will create a profile, but redirect fails specifying path "post/user/login". Not immediate concern, but to be fixed.
