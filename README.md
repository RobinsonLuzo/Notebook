# Notebook: an instagram-like app

Work in progress. Currently enabled to:

Admin at "/admin".

User login at "/user/login". Also creation of new users.

User logout at "/user/logout". To log out at present users must enter this into the bar - not enabled at navbar level yet.

**Note:** Actions involving posting photos etc require a user to be logged in to work correctly. Log in first or create a new profile if starting the app for the first time.
